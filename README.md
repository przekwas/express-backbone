## Instructor

Hello there, I'm Luke Przekwas - your guide through this exciting journey of learning and discovery. With over four years of professional experience as a developer and a passion for teaching, I'm thrilled to bring you this course.

However, my background doesn't just reside in tech. Before transitioning into programming, I was a barista for a decade. You could say I've developed a bit of a connoisseur's palate for coffee, and I'm always ready to recommend an exceptional blend.

When I'm not coding or sipping on a fresh brew, I love to get lost in the immersive world of Dungeons & Dragons. While I enjoy being an active player rather than a Dungeon Master, the collaborative storytelling and strategic gameplay are truly captivating.

Gaming, for me, extends beyond the tabletop. I'm an ardent player of Super Smash Bros. Melee, consistently achieving 16 frames GALINT - a testament to my dedication. I get just as much thrill watching competitive matches as I do participating in them myself.

In recent years, I've started focusing on fitness to maintain my physical and mental well-being. I believe that balance is key in life, and it's a philosophy I apply to my teaching style as well.

This course is more than just a job for me; it's a personal project that I'm eager to share with you. You'll find this same level of dedication when I speedrun Super Punch Out, a quick-thinking game that parallels the detailed and fast-paced world of programming.

Whether you're just starting your programming journey or you're here to master Express, I'm excited to help guide you through this course. I aim not only to instruct, but to inspire and foster a love for coding that matches my own. Let's embark on this adventure together to create the ultimate project backbone using Express and TypeScript!
